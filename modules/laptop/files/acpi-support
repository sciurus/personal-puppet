# Configuration file for the acpi-support package
#
#
# The acpi-support package is intended as "glue" to make special functions of
# laptops work. Specifically, it translates special function keys for some
# laptop models into actions or generic function key presses.
#


#
# Suspend/hibernate method
# ------------------------
#
# When gnome or kde power management daemons are running, acpi-support will
# translate the suspend and hibernate keys of laptops into special "suspend"
# and "hibernate" keys that these daemons handle.
#
# Only in situations where there is no power management daemon
# running, acpi-support needs to perform suspend/hibernate in some other way.
# Beginning with version 0.122-1 acpi-support solely uses pm-utils then.

# Comment the next line to disable ACPI suspend to RAM
ACPI_SLEEP=true

# Comment the next line to disable suspend to disk
ACPI_HIBERNATE=true

# Use Radeontool to switch the screen off? Seems to be needed on some machines
# RADEON_LIGHT=true

# Comment this out to disable screen locking on resume
LOCK_SCREEN=true

# Uncomment this to enable ACPI sleep when the lid screen is closed.
LID_SLEEP=true

# On some systems pressing the wireless button only results in an event that we
# handle, but not in some hardware enforced action. On these systems we are
# free to choose whether or not we cycle through "Both on, Both off, Wireless
# only, Bluetooth only" as we used to do, or if we just do "Both on, Both off"
# as the hardware kill switch does on most systems.
#
# For compatibility reasons with older version the larger cycle is the default.
# Enable this to to have both in switched on and off simultaniously. 
#WIRELESS_BLUETOOTH_SYNC=true

# Choose the method used to switch off/on the display. Available options are
# "xset", "xrandr" and "vbetool".
DISPLAY_DPMS=xset

# xrandr needs the outout device to be named
XRANDR_OUTPUT=LVDS

# vbetool can switch off/on the display even if no user is logged in. However,
# there are systems that do not reset the display when coming out of suspend,
# so that the screen remains dark. Unable this option to switch off the display
# even if no one is logged in.
#DISPLAY_DPMS_NO_USER=true
